AI TESTER PROGRAM

The tester includes two different programs :
-A simple min-max connect 4 AI which finds the best play for the current board (playboard.txt) and sends it to the Referee;
-A Referee which plays each turn and set the winner if any.
For the goods of testing, an Humain Machine Interface UI.exe is also included.

HOW TO USE :

-Open a cmd in the Tester file
-Launch the program "Referee.exe" :
Referee.exe [Depth] [Path of AI to be tested]
The Tester program is launched by launching the Referee and giving it the depth of the AI included in the tester and path of the AI to be tested.
The depth value is a balance between the tester's speed and the power of the tester's AI and depends mainly of the computer's power. If you're not sure about what number assign, take for example 7 and increase if the program's speed is correct.
The path can be relative or absolute. 

The Referee creates and sets the Playboard in "playboard.txt" file, launches one of the AI programs each tour, receives their play, and update the playboard.
The mean of communication between the AI and the Referee is the following pipe :
	    hPipe = CreateFile(TEXT("\\\\.\\pipe\\Pipe"), 
                       GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE, 
                       0,
                       NULL,
                       OPEN_EXISTING,
                       0,
                       NULL);
On a play, the Referee verifies if it is valid (ie. the row is not full) ; if the play is invalid, the Referee stops the game and disqualifies the current player.
After playing, the Referee checks is a player has won ; if so, it stops the game and gives the winner.

The UI program is a Human Machine Interface where a user can see the state of the board and enter the row where he or she wants to play.

The file "playboard.txt" displays the board like this :
0 = Empty box
1 = Player 1's token (Tester's AI)
2 = Player 2's token (tested AI)
